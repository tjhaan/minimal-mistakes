The global spread of antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria is a crisis at the forefront of public health today. Many of the antibiotics used clinically are derived from secondary metabolites produced by soil microbes implicating soils as a reservoir of both antibiotic producing and resistant bacteria. In the arctic climate change and soil disturbances, like wildfires, augment permafrost thaw which changes the physical and chemical properties of overlying active layer soils. These changes shift microbial communities in return shifting the abundance and types of antibiotic resistance genes comprising the resistome. In this research I use genomics to examine how disturbance induced thaw affects the resistome of Alaskan soil communities.


**OVERVIEW OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ANTIBIOIC RESISTANCE AND SOILS**
---

Antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria is one of the greatest threats we face to public health today. Previously treatable pathogens can become resistant to commonly used antibiotics by either aquiring a mutation to their own genome or by recieving an antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) via horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from other bacteria in their environment. Our reliance on antibiotics in clinical, agricultural, and veterinary settings has led to an overuse of antibiotics that contributes to the evolution of antibiotic resistance by selecting for bacteria that have developed or aquired a resistance determinant. However, diverse ARGs have been identified across globally-distributed microbial habitats, including those with minimal human inputs such as 30,000 year old Beringian permafrost sediment. This worldwide ARG presence paired with the fact that around 2/3 of our antibiotics are derived from bioactive compounds synthesized by soil dwelling bacteria and fungi suggests selective pressures favoring the maintenance of ARGs extend beyond a clinical sense to microbial biomes predisposed to evolutionary pressures such as resource competition via competitive inhibition in soils.


 Soils are one of the *richest microbial habitats* on earth both in terms of microbial diversity and abundance. They host a higher prevalence of antibiotic producing and resistant bacterial taxa compared to other non-soil environmnetal biomes. The higher prevelance of ARGs is often attributed to the hypothesized co-evolutionary ‘arms-shields race’ between producers and co-evolved resistant bacteria, however, it is difficult to attribute exact selective forces affecting soil-borne ARGs due to the biological complexity of soils and technical challenges in measuring antibiotic concentrations. Other factors have been found to enrich the abundance of ARGs in soils such as nitrogen amendment, heavy metal pollution, and urbanization. However, globally impactful factors that may enrich ARGs, such as those associated with climate change (e.g. wildfires, flooding, etc.) are largely understudied despite the risk posed by soils as a reservoir of ARGs available for HGT with pathogens.


**ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE IN ALASKAN SOILS**

Alaskan soils are currently experiencing the effects of climate change as temperature in polar regions over the last half-century were 1.5 to 4.5 times higher than the global average.  These higher temps have led to an increased frequency and intensity of soil disturbance events, like wildfires and thermokarst formation.  Soil disturbances affect the composition of vegetation, soil chemistry, rate of permafrost thaw, and microbial community composition.  Shifts in microbial community composition can negatively affect plant health and shift the composition and abundance of ARGs, including ARGs on plasmids, within soils.  Thus soils in Alaka may provide key insight into how shifting conditions with climate change will affect the emergence, selection, and dissemination of ARGs moving forward.  These findings could have major implications for health globally by providing insight into what ARGs and bacteria can arise as a clinical threat.

To address how disturbance-induced shifts in Alaskan soil bacteria affect antibiotic resistance I used *(1)* culture based susceptiblity testing paired with whole genome sequencing to examine antibiotic resistance in cultivable soil bacteria, *(2)* long-read metagenomics to assess how community shifts with soil disturbance affect ARGs, and *(3)* HiC proximity ligation to generate and examine ARGs from the genomes of uncultivable bacteria.
