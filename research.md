    title: "Antibiotic Resistance in Active Layer Bacteria"
    excerpt: "The global spread of antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria is a crisis at the forefront of public health today. Many of our antibiotics used clinically are derived from secondary metabolites produced by soil bacteria making soils a reservoir of both antibiotic producing and resistant bacteria. In the arctic climate change and soil disturbances, like wildfires, augment permafrost thaw which changes the physical and chemical properties of overlying active layer soils.  These changes shift microbial communities in return shifting the abundance and types of antibiotic resistance genes comprising the resistome. In this research I use genomics to examine how disturbance induced thaw affects the resistome of active layer soil communities."

    excerpt: "With massive advancments in next-generation sequencing capabilities, biological sciences are shifting towards a big data approach. I am interested in how we can use these technologies through the lens of genomics to shape the way we approach one health, epidemiology, and microbial sciences."

    title: "One Health In a Changing World"
    excerpt: "Disease outbreaks over the past century have recurrently threatened global public health, animal health and biodiversity conservation. The zoonoses such as SARS, Ebola, Zika, swine and avian flu highlight the link between animal and human health.  It is increasingly apparent that a one health approach to science that takes into account human, animal and ecological health will be increasingly important for understanding how anthropogenic activities including globalization, climate change, land use change and urbanization will lead to the emergence of novel diseases."

My current research interests revolve around how we can address the intersectionality of environmental, animal, and human health through the lens of genomics.  Below are more in depth and specific overviews of various aspects of my current work.
