## My teaching philosophy is built upon the following key components: 
![](/assets/images/presenting.jpg/){:width="200px"
style="float: right;margin-right: 50px;margin-top: 20px;"}
+ Balancing fundamentals and critical thinking skills
+ Student focused learning outcomes 
+ Modular and flexible lesson plans 
+ Learning through active engagement

By employing these components, students should gain an understanding of how to use the scientific process to conduct research and critically examine data to independently and accurately draw conclusions.

# Teaching Experiences
## Undergraduate Research and Scholarly Activity Mentor
*Spring 2020 University of Alaska Fairbanks*

![](/assets/images/ADAK.png/){:width="500px"
style="float: right;margin-right: 30px;margin-top: 20px;"}
+ Developed a multi-week workshop that taught nine undergraduates how to design a study, screen soil microbes for antibiotic production, extract & sequence DNA, and then assemble and analyze genomes.
+ Taught the fundamentals of microbiological and genomics research.
+ Published a paper based on the genomes of seven of the antibiotic producers with another manuscript in progress.
+ One undergraduate continued to work in the lab using HPLC to analyze compounds produced, now moving on to pharmacy school.

## Student Learning Coach
*Tanana Middle School*
+ Developed online personalized learning intiatives for middle school students.
+ Collaborated with teachers to devise and implement coordinated educational strategies and student support networks.
+ Administered academic guidance and tutoring to students before and after school.
+ Helped students develop year long community engagement project.


## Substitute Teacher
*Fairbanks North Star Borough School District*

+ Followed classroom plans left by teacher to continue student education and reinforce core concepts.
+ Employed adaptability when dealing with unpredictability in the classroom.
+ Kept students on-task with proactive behavior modification and positive reinforcement strategies while upholding classroom routines.

    <th><h2 style="font-weight:normal"> As part of my poster presentation at the 2019 NIH IDeA Western Regional Conference I used a virtual reality headset to let attendees explore the Alaskan boreal forest at my study site. Participants explored three vegetation communities at the Fairbanks Permafrost Experiment Station in order to show how boreal forest vegetation succeeds post disturbance.</h2> <img src="/assets/images/vr_pic.png" width="500"></th>

**Living in a Microbial World**

*1st Grade Outreach*

![](/assets/images/first_grade_outreach.jpg/){:width="300px"
style="float: right;margin-left: 30px;margin-top: 20px;"}

Presented at a first grade classroom in Fairbanks, AK teaching students about how microbes live on and around us, their role in the environment, and how they can impact health and disease.  Students them used agar plates to grow bacteria from their hand and from a site of their choice around the classroom.  Pictures were taken of the plates and returned to the students after growth was observed and then the results of the exploration were discussed in groups.



**Designing a Yeast Experiment**

*2020 virtual science experiment*
![](/assets/images/after_down_annotated.jpg/){:width="300px"
style="float: left;margin-right: 30px;margin-top: 20px;"}

Developed packets and a lesson plan for elementary students to conduct a science experiment at home.  In the lesson plan students were asked to step into the shoes of a scientist to develop a hypothesis and experiment that would answer the question of "what yeast likes to eat?" A class of second grade students at Watershed Elementary School followed our lesson plan and made it a weeklong project where students shared their experiment and results to a class forum online. A website outlining this protocol and materials needed can be found at the link below:

*Mobilizing Alaska genomics: Whatâ€™s in my backyard microbiome?*
![](/assets/images/WAISC.png/){:width="300px"
style="float: right; margin-top: 20px;"}

Helped conduct several sessions of a workshop teaching conference attendees, a classroom of students from Nome (AK), and local Alaskan's how to use MinION sequencing devices and examine microbial data to see what microbes live in the environment.

*2020 Midnight Sun Science Symposium: Biology Virtual Edition & 2020 American Society for Microbiology Alaska Branch Meeting*


Helped organize and develop platforms for virtual conferences as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Developed a [website](https://sites.google.com/alaska.edu/2020msssbiology/home) and virtual meeting logistics for two conferences with a combined number of participants of around 100 individuals.
