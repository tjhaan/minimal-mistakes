<h2>About Me:</h2>
<p>Hello and welcome to my academic website! I am currently a graduate student at the <strong>University of Alaska Fairbanks</strong>  pursuing my <strong>M.S. in Biological Sciences</strong>.  My thesis work delves into how disturbance to permafrost soils affects the types, abundance, and mobility of antibiotic resistance genes in soil microbial communities of the active layer.</p>
<p>More broadly I am interested in one health, which is the intersection between animal, human, plant, and environmental wellbeing, and how we can use data science like genomics to address health challenges.</p>
<h2>Below are links to more information about my research interests, publications, outreach and teaching philosophy:</h2>
