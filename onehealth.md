# ONE HEALTH IN A CHANGING WORLD

Disease outbreaks over the past century have recurrently threatened global public health, animal health and biodiversity conservation. The zoonoses such as SARS, Ebola, Zika, swine and avian flu highlight the link between animal and human health.  It is increasingly apparent that a one health approach to science that takes into account human, animal and ecological health will be increasingly important for understanding how anthropogenic activities including globalization, climate change, land use change and urbanization will lead to the emergence of novel diseases.

# THE ROLE OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN ONE HEALTH

In my research I've unearthed a significant relationship between disturbance to Alaskan soils, such as those caused by wildfires and land-use, and a change in the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Thus as climate change increases the frequency and intensity of soil disturbance events, we will see a change in the types of bacteria and ARGs that reside in Alaskan soils. In this project we also identified ARGs associated with mobile elements, such as plasmids and integrons, across bacterial taxa in Alaskan soils.  These ARGs were identified in common non-pathogenic soil bacteria with high sequence identity to those found in pathogens.  These highly similar, and mobile, ARGs implicates active layer Alaskan soils as a reservoir of ARGs with the potential to compromise human health. These results paired with previous culture-based susceptibility tests that found antibiotic resistance was widespread in soil bacteira, affirms sub-arctic soils are a reservoir of bacteria resistant to clinically significant antibiotics may arise as a clinical threat as human expansion into sub-arctic ecosystems continues.
